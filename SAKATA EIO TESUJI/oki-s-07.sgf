B would like to save his 4 stones on the corner but, since his 2 stones can be put in atari immediately he is at a disadvantage.
Try and find a loophole somewhere.]

It is clear that B 1 hiki immediately is no good, ]

Even if B plays osae 2 instead of 1, W can cut at 1 and nothing can be done about it.])

In that case how about B 1 ? ]

(;B[gr]LB[gr:1]C[Diag. 3 - Correct

There is no alternative to B 1, a way of playing which disregards the defect in his own 2 stones. This oki is excellent ]

In a position where the W 2, B 3 exchange has already been played it is easy to point out the oki of 1, but without this exchange it is surprisingly difficult.])
