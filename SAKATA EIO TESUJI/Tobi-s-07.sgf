There is half an eye in the centre and the 3 W stones on the edge have yet to be captured.

Then how about W 1 sagari? This too lacks an overall plan.

(;B[fr]LB[fr:2][es:1]C[Diag. 4  - Correct

If B answers W 1 at 2,]
;W[fo]LB[fo:3][fr:2][es:1]C[W 3 destroys the eye in the centre.
Because of 1, B cannot live as he did in Diag. 1.
This tobi is a skillful move, creating miai points to take an eye or connect along the edge.])))
