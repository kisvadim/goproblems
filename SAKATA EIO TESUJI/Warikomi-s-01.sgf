Warikomi is a severe way of exploiting the opponent's weak point.
With this suji you can revive stones which are almost dead, or find unexpected combinations.
In short, it is a tesuji of exceptional charm.
In this collection hanekomi is included under the heading of warikomi.
Since the black group is not alive you are to think of a way to link up with the group on the right.]
