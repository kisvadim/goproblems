Examples of kosumi deciding the life or death of an opponent's group are common.
The 4 B stones and the 4 W stones are in a semeai and there is one move for B to win]

B 1 is an interesting idea, ]

Seki is failure.])

B cannot win even by filling in the inside liberties. ]
;W[fs]LB[gq:A][gr:1][fs:2]C[When W plays 2 hane, B is in damezumari.
If B plays "A" instead of 1, this is very bad. After W hane it is a complete failure.

B 1 kosumi is the correct answer. ]

;B[gr]LB[gr:3][es:2][gs:1]C[then B 3 and B wins the semeai by one move.
This 1 does not allow the hane of W 2 in the previous diagram and therefore it contains the secret of success.
W ate 3 instead of 2 is impossible.]))
