Ex. 1 Stratagem

The effect of a good kiri is wonderful.
It is a sharp tesuji, but because awful things can happen when it is misused you should use it with circumspection in actual games.
Try to split the B group in two.]PL[W]

If W simply comes out at 1,]

Of course W 1 tsugi is no good.]

W's cut 1 here is an interesting move. ]

B 2 watari in reply to W 1 kiri ]
