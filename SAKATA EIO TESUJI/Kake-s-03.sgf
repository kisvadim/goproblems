B's 2 stones cannot be captured by shicho and it is extremely difficult for W to settle both his groups at the same time.

W 1 kake is the sabaki tesuji.
If you can get into the way of thinking that it is alright to sacrifice stones, sabaki becomes unexpectadly simple.
The main thing is how the sacrifice is carried out.]
