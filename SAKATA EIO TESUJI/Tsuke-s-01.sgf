Ex. 1 - Life and death

Tsuke is a relatively easy suji but it is an effective means, in actual games, of cutting to opponent to the quick.
In this first example you are to try and capture W in the corner.
You should look for the vital point.]

W lives thanks to the rule of "bent four in the corner".])

B 1 is one kind of vital point but is not applicable to this example.])
