Perhaps there are people who cannot imagine that there is a vital point at which to attack this W group, but in fact a stone played at just such a point will take away W's eye shape.]PL[W]

(;B[bo]LB[cn:A][bo:1]C[Diag 2 - Correct

B 1 should penetrate thus far.
After this one tsuke move W loses the possibility of making eyes on the side.
If Black next plays tsuppari at "A", W will find it necessary to worry about his cutting point. ]

If it is W to play in this position, 1 kosumi is the correct move.
