First of all you should examine the corner.
Next, consider whether there is not some flaw in B's watari connection and you will find the sequence to play.
You should not be satisfied with nibbling away at the lower side.]PL[W]
(;W[gq]LB[gq:1]TR[aa]C[Diag. 1 - Failure

(;W[gs]LB[gs:1]C[Diag. 2 - Correct

From the failure in the previous diagram you will see that W has a certain ammount of flexibility in the corner. 
W 1 oki is a splendid suji, making use of this fact. ]
